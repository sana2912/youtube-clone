ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

        "description": "WATCH: Wenatchee police and the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office provided an update Tuesday evening during a joint press conference about the ongoing investigation and manhunt for Travis Decker, who is accused of kidnapping and killing his three daughters. \n\nThe sheriff’s office said 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn, and 5-year-old Olivia Decker were found dead Monday after a CCSO Forest Service deputy on patrol spotted Decker’s unoccupied 2017 GMC Sierra pickup truck near a campground in Leavenworth. The girls were found after a search of the area, but Decker was nowhere to be found.\n\nDecker is wanted for three counts of first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping in connection with the girls' deaths. The sheriff’s office said Decker is “former military with extensive training.” The reward for any information that leads to Decker's capture is now up to $20,000.\n\nIt is currently unknown if Decker is armed, but authorities said he should be considered armed and dangerous. Authorities described Decker as white, around 5 feet, 8 inches tall, 190 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes.

          "description": "WATCH: Wenatchee police and the Chelan County Sheriff’s Office provided an update Tuesday evening during a joint press conference about the ongoing investigation and manhunt for Travis Decker, who is accused of kidnapping and killing his three daughters. \n\nThe sheriff’s office said 9-year-old Paityn, 8-year-old Evelyn, and 5-year-old Olivia Decker were found dead Monday after a CCSO Forest Service deputy on patrol spotted Decker’s unoccupied 2017 GMC Sierra pickup truck near a campground in Leavenworth. The girls were found after a search of the area, but Decker was nowhere to be found.\n\nDecker is wanted for three counts of first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping in connection with the girls' deaths. The sheriff’s office said Decker is “former military with extensive training.” The reward for any information that leads to Decker's capture is now up to $20,000.\n\nIt is currently unknown if Decker is armed, but authorities said he should be considered armed and dangerous. Authorities described Decker as white, around 5 feet, 8 inches tall, 190 pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a light-colored shirt and dark shorts.\n\nAnyone with information about Decker’s location is asked to call 911 or send a tip to the CCSO online.\n\nSTORY: https://komonews.com/news/local/manhunt-court-documents-3-wenatchee-sisters-chelan-county-travis-decker-35-years-old-20000-dollar-reward-olivia-evelun-paityn-rock-island-campground \n______________\nStay up to date with our social media:\n\nKOMO News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/KOMONews/\nKOMO News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/komonews\nKOMO News on Instagram: http://instagram.com/komo4\nKOMO News on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@komo4seattle\n\nSubscribe to KOMO on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC__2_0RJ8XnHt2angfw6S1Q/?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWatch more top local news stories: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G97AyNO_3IE&list=PLZm7uq7_dyY6qhFFIwgXRvYpkaOnZEabc&index=2&t=0s\n\nFor all of the day’s top local and national news, visit http://www.komonews.com/\nWatch our live newscasts and other live video at https://komonews.com/watch\n\nDownload our iOS App: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/komo-news-mobile/id433508161?mt=8 \n\nDownload our Android App: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newssynergy.komo&hl=en \n\nHave a news tip?
