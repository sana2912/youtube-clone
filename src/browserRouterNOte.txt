 What is <BrowserRouter>?
<BrowserRouter> is a component provided by the React Router library. It keeps your UI in sync with the URL in the browser's address bar.

✅ Why You Need <BrowserRouter>:
Enable navigation without reloading the page
It allows your app to change views (pages/components) using <Route> and <Link> without making a full-page request to the server.

Keeps the UI and URL in sync
If the URL is /about, <BrowserRouter> will help render the component you assigned to that route.

Handles browser history for back/forward navigation
It integrates with the browser’s history API so users can use back/forward buttons normally.
